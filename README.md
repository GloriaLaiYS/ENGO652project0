# Project 0

ENGO 551 - Adv. Topics on Geospatial Technologies

My webpage is about 3 interesting animals, introducing some fun facts and basic knowledges.
The whole project0 file include 4 .html files, one of them is index.html forming the main page, the other 3 .html is about 3 animals in my topic.

There are 5 .css files created for my pages.
I created styles.css, which includes different CSS properties and CSS selectors.
The other 4 were generated from variable.scss, nesting.scss, inheritance.scss.
While each .scss file has a responsive css.map as transition file to css.

Other contents include three pictures used in my website.
